DOM Quiz
Part 1: Theoretical Questions
DOM Basics:

What is the difference between a Node and an Element in the DOM?
How do you select an element by its id in the DOM?
Creating Content:

What are the steps to dynamically create and append an element to the DOM?
Why should you prefer textContent over innerHTML in most cases?
Events:

What is the purpose of event delegation, and when would you use it?
Explain the difference between event.target and event.currentTarget.
Performance:

What is document.createDocumentFragment() used for?
Why should frequent DOM updates be batched?
Part 2: Practical Challenges
Dynamic List Generation
Create a <ul> with 5 <li> items. Each <li> should include the text Item X (where X is the item number) and a "Remove" button to delete the item. Use event delegation for the remove functionality.

Debounced Input Field
Create an input field that logs the userâ€™s typed value to the console only after they stop typing for 1 second.

Event Delegation in Action

Create a <div> container with 3 child <button> elements.
Add a single event listener to the <div> that logs the button text when any button is clicked.
Batch Updates with DocumentFragment
Add 50 <p> elements to the <body>, all containing the text "Hello, DOM!" in a single operation using DocumentFragment.

Bonus Challenge
Combine all your knowledge into a mini app:

Create a to-do list app where users can:
Add new tasks via an input field and button.
Remove tasks with a "Delete" button (using event delegation).
Edit tasks inline by clicking on the text.
